/* LAYER: behavior (THE TOP PRIORITY LAYER) */

/*
    This file - in combination with the imported css files - represents the
    very core of LectureDoc's css. It primarily defines css properties
    directly related to the core functionality of LectureDoc. I.e., how topics
    are displayed in the different modes. The CSS classes defined in
    this file are (often) used by LectureDoc's API. Hence, any changes here, may
    require code changes in other CSS and/or JavaScript files.

    Styling related to the content of slides is defined elsewhere.

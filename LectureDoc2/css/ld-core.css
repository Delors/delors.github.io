    This is LectureDoc's core CSS file. It primarily defines css properties 
    directly related to the core functionality of LectureDoc. I.e., how slides 
    are rendered in the different modes. The CSS classes defined in this file 
    are (often) used by LectureDoc. Hence, any changes here, may require code
    changes in other CSS and/or JavaScript files.
    
    All styling information related to LectureDoc's widgets is found in 
    ld-theme.css.

    Styling related to slides is defined in user defined css file.

/*  We need a fixed size for slides to make the content as a whole 
    scalable using the scale property. The scale property is set/updated 
    using Javascript. 

    Conceptually, - for the slides view - we would like to have some CSS like:
    
        scale: min(calc(100vh/1080px),calc(100vw/1920px)); 
    
    But such CSS computations are not yet supported at least until 2024.

    The actual (fixed) size, however, doesn't really matter, because the content
    is scaled anyway. Nevertheless, when external content is embededd (in 
    particular images) it makes sense to have a size that resembles a "natural"
    screen resolution to avoid having the creator to scale everything up or down
    when adding media content. 
    Nevertheless, in the end all that matters is the aspect ratio.

.code.copy-to-clipboard div.ld-copy-to-clipboard-button 
___________________________________

LectureDoc has special support for enabling copy to clipboard functionality. 
If a code block (i.e., a DIV or PRE element with the class "code" and also 
"copy-to-clipboard") is found, LectureDoc will add a copy "button" to the code
block by means of a div with the class ld-copy-to-clipboard-button.

Example:
<div class="code copy-to-clipboard">
    <div class="ld-copy-to-clipboard-button">Copy</div> <!-- added by LectureDoc -->
    <pre><code>...</code></pre>
</div>

or

<pre class="code copy-to-clipboard">
    <div class="ld-copy-to-clipboard-button">Copy</div> <!-- added by LectureDoc -->
    <code>...</code>
</pre>

.code.copy-to-clipboard div.ld-copy-to-clipboard-button
